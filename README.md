## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I initially tried to use CSS grid for this project, but eventually realized I couldn't achieve the wrapping effect I desired to make the project work, so I settled for flexbox. I did use grid for the underlying container though as an experiment and to practice grid since I haven't utilized it much. I could have achieved the result without it, but I would like to use it more in the future.

I would also like to be more comfortable with approximate measurements. Too often looking at the Figma design file, I'm too focused worrying about precise measurements that I result to using px instead of something more responsive like rem or em. For this project, I used rem but as a result of going for exact measurements, I ended with unfavorable decimal values to reflect exact pixel values.
